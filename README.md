# AD_Batching
This repo contains my M.Tech thesis about improving anomaly detection model with novel batching technique  
The technique is tested on RTFM model and has improved the AUC of curve by 2%  
The model is run on NVIDIA RTX 3060 laptop gpu for 15k epochs  
The results can be seen from the following ROC curves:  
The original model
